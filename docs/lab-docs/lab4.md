# LAB 4: Transfer Functions & Transient Response

<!-- ### Description:
* Learn how to create transfer functions for the physical dynamic systems:
    * Mass-spring-damper
    * DC motor
    * Self-balancing robot
* Perform open-loop step response (transient response) for each system, especially the self-balancing robot

### What to Submit:
* Report showing a summary of exercises completed by hand as well as with MATLAB.
    * MATLAB generated plot of the transient response of each dynamic systems -->
