# Lab 3: Laplace Transforms & Mathematical Modeling II

![work_in_progress](../media/wip.jpg)

<!-- ### Description:
* Learn how to perform laplace transforms on the physical dynamic systems:
    * Mass-spring-damper
    * ~~RLC circuit~~
    * DC motor
    * Self-balancing robot

### What to Submit:
* Report showing a summary of exercises completed by hand as well as with MATLAB.




#### Introduction

Welcome to the second session of the ES3011 experimental labs. In this lab, we focus on mathematical modeling. The central question is *"How do describe/model our physical system mathematically to be able to anaylze its behavior?"*

We will cover two sections in this lab:

1. Mathematical modeling of basic dynamical systems

2. Mathematical modeling of self-balancing robot system

##### Learning Outcomes
Our goal at the end of this labs is that you should be able to:

* Understand and describe/model physical dynamic systems mathematically using differential equations
* Convert the differential equations to state-space model form by hand and using MATLAB functionality -->
