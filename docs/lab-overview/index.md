# ES3011 Controls Lab Documentation

Welcome to the ES3011 Experimental!

We're excited to have you join us as we pilot this hands-on lab option for the ES3011 class.

In this lab, you will get to hands-on experience learning fundamental control system concepts such as modeling, control design and analysis using the BalBot (self-balancing robot).

!!! note 
    The overarching goal of this lab is to **analyze and design a feedback controller** for the BalBot robot, to keep it robust to disturbances.
